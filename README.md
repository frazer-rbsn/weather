A weather app that I created for a job application.

The app is written in 100% Swift and SwiftUI. It uses the OpenMeteo API service for retrieving weather data, and the Geocoding API provided by maps.co for location lookups.
For the app to function, you must create your own API Key at https://geocode.maps.co/ and set it as an environment key as GEOCODING_API_KEY.
